The comma-separated list of alternative DNS names to use for the local host.

When the node generates a CSR for itself, these are added to the request
as the desired `subjectAltName` in the certificate: additional DNS labels
that the certificate is also valid answering as.

This is generally required if you use a non-hostname `certname`, or if you
want to use `puppet kick` or `puppet resource -H` and the primary certname
does not match the DNS name you use to communicate with the host.

This is unnecessary for agents, unless you intend to use them as a server for
`puppet kick` or remote `puppet resource` management.

It is rarely necessary for servers; it is usually helpful only if you need to
have a pool of multiple load balanced masters, or for the same master to
respond on two physically separate networks under different names.
